		<h4> Why you should become involved in Our Activities : </h4>
		<ol class ="col">
			<li>Art influences society by changing opinions, instilling values and translating experiences across space and time. Research has shown art affects the fundamental sense of self. Painting, sculpture, music, literature and the other arts are often considered to be the repository of a society's collective memory.</li>
			<br>
			<li>The arts bring us joy, help us express our values, and build bridges between cultures. The arts are also a fundamental component of a healthy community—strengthening them socially, educationally, and economically—benefits that persist even in difficult social and economic times.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Art expresses the non-verbal. And despite our heavy emphasis on the verbal and written, there’s a vast realm of human experience that can only be understood and supported without words.</li>
